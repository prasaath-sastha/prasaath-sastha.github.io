Hi,

I‚Äôm **Prasaath**! I recently graduated with a Master‚Äôs in Drug Discovery and Toxicology. Originally from India, I moved to the UK in 2022 for my studies, and these past two years have been an incredible journey.

üîùThis is how I look on a good day with perfect lighting and some Photoshop.

#### Education

1.  MSc. Drug Discovery and Toxicology \| University of Hertfordshire (2022 - 2024)
2.  Doctor of Pharmacy \| Vinayaka Missions Research Foundation (2015 - 2021)

#### Work Experience

1.  Quality Control Analyst intern \| Eisai Manufacturing Limited (2023-2024)
2.  Research Assistant \| Amura Health (2021-2022)

More information about my me can be found on this site and [click here](cv.qmd) for my CV.

I‚Äôm always eager to learn and try new things‚Äîthat's at the center of my approach toward anything life. My personal motto is a Latin phrase that resonated deeply with me, ***Aut inveniam viam aut faciam*** (I shall either find a way or make one), reflects that perfectly. When I‚Äôm not studying, working, or hitting the gym, you‚Äôll probably find me watching anime or catching up on TV series.

During my time working with Amura Health, I realized how much of a privilege good health really is. It‚Äôs something you have to actively work towards, and that‚Äôs why I stay mindful of what I eat and make staying active a priority.

Lately, I‚Äôve been diving into R for data analysis, which has opened the door to learning Quarto, Git, and GitHub (just out of curiosity and exploration). In fact, I built this page using Quarto and deployed it via GitHub Pages!
