### Hello 👋

I'm Prasaath, a recent master's graduate from the University of Hertfordshire. I studied Drug discovery and toxicology, and apart from that I am currently exploring the health data science world. My interests lie in understanding health data and being able to use it to study health outcomes. I am a pharmacist by training, registered in India.

I am fairly new to Git Hub and the programming world. However, I have been spending a lot of time learning to use R for data analysis and visualisation. During this time, I recreated my [Master's thesis](https://prasaath-sastha.github.io/MSc-Project/) in an accessible quarto book format and even managed to create a [portfolio](https://prasaath-sastha.github.io/) website and hosted them on gh pages. 

Projects I hope to work on are:

- 📦 R packages
- 🐍 Python packages
- 🧑‍⚕️Health data and outcomes research
- 📊 Data visualisation and dashboards
- 🔬 Academic research
