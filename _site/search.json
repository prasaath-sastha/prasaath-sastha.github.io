My point is, there is nothing special about me. Just another person who shares the same space as everyone else.\nI made this website using Quarto and R.

Analysis includes assay, relative substances or impurities, content uniformity, using HPLC (PDA/NonPDA), dissolution and UV.\nCreated workflow dashboards on Monday.com in stability sample management and reporting timelines. Worked with custom formulae to automate sample pull dates, testing requirements and analyst notifications as per the product stability protocol and supporting stability SOPs. Updated validated spreadsheets to calculate assay, related substances, and dissolution results to improve workflow and reporting results.\n\n\n\n\nResearch Assistant\n\nAmura Health, Aug 2021 to Aug 2022\n\nResearched to collect and compile evidence based clinical and non-clinical information relevant to disease of interest to support protocol development.\nCreated relational databases to optimise workflows of physicians and physician assistants and was responsible for their maintenance. Organised and planned collection of body weight data of 1100 clients to analyse and interpret protocol efficacy. Collaborated in making protocol efficacy presentation that showed the firm¬¥s protocols for obesity and diabetes management, which illustrated 60% supremacy.\nBuilt and updated a clinical laboratory report analysis tool that improves the physicians¬¥ report evaluation workflow."

    "text": "Hi,\nI‚Äôm Prasaath! I recently graduated with a Master‚Äôs in Drug Discovery and Toxicology. Originally from India, I moved to the UK in 2022 for my studies, and these past two years have been an incredible journey.\nüîùThis is how I look on a good day with perfect lighting and some Photoshop.\n\nEducation\n\nMSc. Drug Discovery and Toxicology | University of Hertfordshire (2022 - 2024)\nDoctor of Pharmacy | Vinayaka Missions Research Foundation (2015 - 2021)\n\n\n\nWork Experience\n\nQuality Control Analyst intern | Eisai Manufacturing Limited (2023-2024)\nResearch Assistant | Amura Health (2021-2022)\n\nMore information about my me can be found on this site and click here for my CV.\nI‚Äôm always eager to learn and try new things‚Äîthat‚Äôs at the center of my approach toward anything life. My personal motto is a Latin phrase that resonated deeply with me, Aut inveniam viam aut faciam (I shall either find a way or make one), reflects that perfectly. When I‚Äôm not studying, working, or hitting the gym, you‚Äôll probably find me watching anime or catching up on TV series.\nDuring my time working with Amura Health, I realized how much of a privilege good health really is. It‚Äôs something you have to actively work towards, and that‚Äôs why I stay mindful of what I eat and make staying active a priority.\nLately, I‚Äôve been diving into R for data analysis, which has opened the door to learning Quarto, Git, and GitHub (just out of curiosity and exploration). In fact, I built this page using Quarto and deployed it via GitHub Pages!"
