Honestly, I did not have much to do after my master's thesis. I had completed my experiments, collected data, processed it on excel, analyzed and plotted them on GraphPad Prism, and finally finished the write up. I still had a lot of time, and of-course, the allotted time for laboratory work was over and so no more experiments could be planned. I was going through my report, and then looked at the plots. These plots generated from GraphPad were really amazing. I have an habit of looking for different programs to make my tasks more efficient and professional. In the past, this has introduced me to a variety of tools such as publisher, adobe illustrator, to content creation tools such as videoscribe and explaindio. Minitab was the first tool I discovered for statistical operations, later GraphPad. To be entirely honest, I wanted to do something with my time. My google feed had this post, **Which is better, R or Python - for data analysis**
